            <h2>Personas</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>This user is a 25 year old female and newly married. She and her husband are 
                    looking at options for their Friday night date. They have 2 ideas, going to 
                    the theater or mini golfing. Before they make their decision, they want 
                    to take a look at what the weather is going to be like for Friday night. 
                    If the weather will be poor, they would choose to go to the theater. 
                    On the other hand, if the weather will be clear then they might choose 
                    to go mini golfing. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    This user is a 65 year old, retired male. He loves camping with his grandkids. 
                    He wants to take his 3 grandkids camping this weekend in the hills 
                    near one of the 3 towns covered by this site. They only want to go camping 
                    if the weather is going to be good. Before they decide to go, they will want 
                    to check what the weather is going to be like during the upcoming weekend.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    A user might be looking at going camping during the weekend. Knowing 
                    what the weather might be could be the difference between actually 
                    going and staying home.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A user might be interested in attending an event one evening during the winter. 
                    In making their decition to attend or not they might want to check to see
                    if it is supposed to snow or ice that night. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    A user might be planning an outdoor party in their back yard. They would 
                    want to check the weather before commiting to having the event outdoors. 
                    If there is going to be bad weather then the user might want to move the 
                    party inside. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    A user might be trying to figure out what they want to wear for the day.
                    Before making the decision, the user might want to check what the weather
                    might be like for the day. What the user chooses to wear could depend greatly 
                    on the weather for that day.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A user might want to go fishing one day. While planning his trip he will
                    want to check the weather. If there is a forecast of thunderstorms or rain then 
                    he would most likely want to reschedule his trip.
